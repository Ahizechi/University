The calculator performs all the requirements and some additional ones. You can
see what operations can be performed and how to use them in the 'How_To_Use' text
file. The 'How_To_Use' text file also prints to the screen (see demo video).

To start the calculator:

- Run Server.py
- Run Calculator.py
- The server should now connect to the client and the calculator can be used.
